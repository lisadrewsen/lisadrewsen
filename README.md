# Hei, I'm Lisa 👋

Trying cool things. Learning as I go. Usually caffeinated.

## 🌱 What I'm Into
Currently working at **S-Tron** in Shanghai, helping connect Nordic and Chinese startup ecosystems. I love building things from scratch—whether it’s a WeChat mini app, a running club, or sourcing a humanoid robot for a hacker house in Finland.

## 🛠️ Projects I’ve Tried
- 🏃‍♀️ **FRC Beijing** – Founded the Founders Running Club chapter in Beijing. Now planning a Shanghai edition with Slush (FRC Shanghai coming soon 😉).
- 🍓 **Berry Research Institute** – Supporting early-stage efforts to launch a clinical research institute in Finland.
- 🍄 **Altpro** – Helped raise funding for fungi-based collagen. Learned a ton about pitching and investor dynamics.
- 🧪 **Bilberry Probiotic** – A side project that didn’t work out, but taught me what *not* to do.
